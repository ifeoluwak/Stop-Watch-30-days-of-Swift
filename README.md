# Simple StopWatch Using Auto Layouts Programmatically

## Hi Community ##

I'm Ifeoluwa King, Mobile developer at [Bambooks](https:bambooks.io). I came across [Allen Wang](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift) 30 Days of Swift project and decided to try it out myself.

This project is based on his own example but without the use storyboards, only using Auto Layout programmatically.
